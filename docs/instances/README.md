# Instances
An Instance is the application in the TrakHound Framework that is used to host App, Api, Function, and Service modules. Instances act as the "gateway" for data moving between multiple Instances and act as the layer of abstraction for modules.

An Instance can be installed on each device or can act as a central hub. Making the Instance serve multiple purposes keeps installation simple and development consolidated.
